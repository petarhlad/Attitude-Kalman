\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kalman Filter is avery good and powerful tool to work with dynamical systems
\item There is a better version for attitude estimation using quaternions on a linear Kalman Filter, but the formulations is more complicated.
\item To evaluate performance of setup, would need other tools to measure actual attitude.
\end{itemize}

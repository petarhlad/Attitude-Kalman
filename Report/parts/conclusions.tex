\section{Conclusions}
As seen in a previous presentation about Kalman Filter, Kalman Filter is avery good and powerful tool to work with dynamical systems. Only need to formulate the dynamical system, and the Kalman Filter algorithm will perform the sensor fusion.

Although attitude estimation with nonlinear functions using Extended Kalman Filter works, there is a better formulation of the system using quaternions, making it linear. Thus, Kalman Filter would be optimal in this case. For this project, the quaternion formulation was not used necause of high complexity.

To wrap the conclusions, it would be nice to have had a system that measures the actual attitude so the output of the Kalman Filter could be compared and thus the performance of it evaluated.
